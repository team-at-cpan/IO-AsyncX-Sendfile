Revision history for {{$dist->name}}

{{$NEXT}}
	Features:
	* Provides the string exception as the first parameter to ->fail() on failure,
	for consistency with other IO::Async components.

	Dependencies:
	* Attempt to prevent installation on windows - test reports contain "Attempt to free unreferenced scalar" errors even on the compilation tests, and I suspect the platform doesn't have the underlying API call anyway
